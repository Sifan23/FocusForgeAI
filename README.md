# FocusForge AI – Your Adaptive Productivity Coach

**Hackathon:** Commit To Change: AI Agents Hackathon  
**Category:** Productivity & Work Habits  
**Prize Track:** Best Project + Best Use of Opik  

**Tagline:** An agentic AI that learns your energy patterns, intelligently schedules tasks, anticipates disruptions (especially in unpredictable environments like Ethiopia), and helps you build lasting productive habits.

## Problem it solves
Many people struggle with "time blindness", inconsistent schedules, and external disruptions (power outages, traffic, internet issues). FocusForge goes beyond reminders: it **proactively** reschedules tasks, suggests optimal times, mitigates obstacles automatically, and adapts to what actually works for **you**.

## Unique Value Proposition
- Contextual awareness for regions with unstable infrastructure (offline task suggestions, power-outage mode, local holiday awareness)
- Multilingual support (English + Amharic planned)
- Deep personalization through continuous learning
- Strong observability & evaluation via **Opik** (experiments, LLM-as-judge, regression tests, dashboards)

## Tech Stack (planned)
- **Agent Framework:** LangGraph / LangChain
- **LLM:** Grok / OpenAI / Anthropic (we'll compare via Opik)
- **Tools & Integrations:** Google Calendar API, Todoist, Twilio (SMS), local news/weather APIs
- **Observability:** Comet Opik (prompt tuning, trajectory evaluation, metrics tracking)
- **Frontend (optional MVP):** Streamlit or Gradio for demo

## Current Status
Just starting development – core agent prototype coming next!
